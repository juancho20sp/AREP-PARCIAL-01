# ECI Clima
This is a small web application that gives the user the opportunity to fetch some data using **sockets** and a 
custom **HTTP Server**.


## Architecture

---
The custom server pro

This is a simple _Client-Server_ architecture using an **APIRest** approach. The **backend** is a Spark application that exposes two endpoints that the **frontend** consumes. The communication is based on the REST protocol using **JSON** as standard for sending and receiving messages.

The REST method used form communication is the **GET** method and the values required for doing the calculations are sent as _query params_ using the **value** key.

### API

---

**Base URL**

```url
https://parcial-01-arep-murillo.herokuapp.com/
```

### ENDPOINTS

---
The project exposes two **endpoints**, the first one is **/clima** and gives the user a friendly interface to call 
the backend service of fetching the weather of a specific zone.

```url
/clima
```

For directly calling the backend service that fetchs the weather data.

```url
/consulta?ciudad={CITY}
```
Where **CITY** is the name of the city which we want to get the weather.

### REQUESTS

---

All the requests are sent as **GET** requests to the backend. 


### RESPONSES

---

If a request is **successfully** sent to the server, it will respond with a **text/html** file if the endpoint 
called is _/clima_and a **application/json** file if the endpoint called is _/consulta_.
